# graph_data_science

Following algorithms are planned to be implemented, 

* Path Finding - help find the shortest path or evaluate the availability and quality of routes

* Centrality - algorithms to determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network

* Community Detection - algorithms to evaluate how a group is clustered or partitioned, as well as its tendency to strengthen or break apart

* Similarity - algorithms to help calculate the similarity of nodes

* Topological link prediction - algorithms to determine the closeness of pairs of nodes

* Node Embeddings - algorithms to compute vector representations of nodes in a graph.

* Node Classification - classification algorithms that uses machine learning to predict the classification of nodes.

* Link prediction - prediction algorithms that use machine learning to predict new links between pairs of nodes
